# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm **Hung Pham**, a passionate software developer and lifelong tech learner from Vietnam.

I focus on building clean, modern, and scalable web applications using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and frameworks like **React**, **Node.js**, and **Express**. Iâ€™m currently exploring backend services, APIs, and deploying full-stack applications using tools like **MongoDB**, **Firebase**, and **Vercel**.

I enjoy working on side projects, solving programming challenges, and contributing to open-source. I'm always experimenting with new technologies and looking for ways to improve my workflow and code quality.

This website is my personal hub where I:
- Showcase projects I'm working on
- Write about what I learn
- Document my progress as a developer

I'm also open to collaboration on open-source tools, technical writing, and freelance opportunities.
