# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm **Hung Pham** â€“ a software developer and tech enthusiast based in Vietnam.

I specialize in building modern web applications using technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and frameworks like **React** and **Node.js**. I enjoy creating personal tools, learning about web standards, and contributing to open-source.

This website is my digital playground, where I document my projects, experiments, and things I learn.

You can find my code and contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/hungphambkc), and Iâ€™m always open to collaboration or freelance opportunities.
